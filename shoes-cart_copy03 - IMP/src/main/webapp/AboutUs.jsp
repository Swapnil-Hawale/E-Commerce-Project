 <p><b> About Us </b></p> <br>
   
          When Amazon.com launched in 1995, it was with the mission to be Earth's most customer-centric company.
    What does this mean? It's simple. We're a company that obsesses over our customers. 
    Our actions, goals, projects, programs and inventions begin and end with the customer top of mind.
    In other words, we start with the customer and work backwards. When we hit on something that is
    really working for customers, we double-down on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success.
    However, it’s not always as clean as that. Inventing is messy, and over time, it’s certain that 
    we’ll fail at some big bets too.You'll also hear us say that at Amazon, it's always Day 1.
    What do we mean? Our approach remains the same as it was on Amazon’s very first day —
     to make smart, fast decisions, stay nimble, innovate and invent, and focus on delighting customers.
